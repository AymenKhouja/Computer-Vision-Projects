# Computer Vision Projects Repository 📚




## Introduction 🎉

Welcome to the Computer vision projects Repository! 🚀 In this repository, you will find a collection of Computer Vision (CV) projects that I have worked on in the Kaggle platform. Each notebook presents a different Computer vision project, showcasing various techniques and approaches to solve real-world vision challenges.

The main objective of this repository is to share knowledge, insights, and implementations related to CV tasks. Whether you are an AI engineer, Computer vision enthusiast, or someone looking to get introduced to computer vision techniques, this repository has something for you! 🌟
